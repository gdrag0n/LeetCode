#Approach

The idea is to use hash-map.
to go through each item's value-weight pair, it'll be easier to combine both lists
upon combination, if a value is occurring for the first time, it is appended to the dictionary
and if it has already occurred, their weights are summed up

then sorting occurs alongside conversion of the dictionary back into a 2d array


```
class Solution:
    def mergeSimilarItems(self, items1: List[List[int]], items2: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    
    
        items=items1+items2
        n=len(items)
        dic={}
        
        for i in range(n):
            a=items[i][0]
            b=items[i][1]
            
            if a in list(dic.keys()):
                dic[a]=dic[a]+b

            else:
                dic[a]=b

        ret=sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x:x[0])
        return ret
```
