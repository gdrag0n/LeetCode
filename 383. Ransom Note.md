# Solution

I was able to reach a proper solution after doing Q. 242.
It taught me that the first valid return statement will ignore the upcoming return statements,<br>
and that questions can be made so much simpler if only their conditions are written first instead of getting directly to solving them.
```
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        rn=list(ransomNote)
        mag=list(magazine)

        for i in rn:
            if i not in mag:
                return False
            elif rn.count(i)>mag.count(i):
                return False
            
        return True       
```

#Approach 01
```
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:

        rn=list(ransomNote)
        mag=list(magazine)

        c=0
        for i in rn:
            if i in mag:
                rn.remove(i)
                mag.remove(i)
            else:
                return False

        return not rn
```
