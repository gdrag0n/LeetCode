# Given
```
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
```


## concepts

The bags to be considered are those which are <strong>not empty</strong>.

hence, condition:
```
if capacity[i]!=rocks[i]:
	j=capacity[i]-rocks[i]
	l.append(j)

#l:list of remaining capacities
	
```

### approaches
there can be two:<br>
	1. summation of remaining capacities<br>
	2. reduction of remaining capacities from addditionalRocks<br>

<em>going by approach 2 due to easier implementation</em><br>

## Attempt 01

```
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        
        l=[]
        n=len(capacity)

        for i in range(n):
            if rocks[i] != capacity[i]:
                j=capacity[i]-rocks[i]
                l.append(j)
        
        l.sort()

        m=len(l)
        for k in range(m):
            add = additionalRocks-l[k]
            if add<=0:
                break
                
        return k+1


```

### errors
passed test case 1
failed test case 2<br>

### cases

i noticed an error as a result of a failed test case-<br>c
in the solution, only the bags in which additional rocks are added is considered to be the number of full bags <br>
this is incorrect as some bags must have already been occupied to their full capacity in first for loop, which need to be included as well<br>

<br>

## Attempt 02

based on the cases realized above, the total number of bags occupied are considered <br>


```
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        
        l=[]
        n=len(capacity)

        for i in range(n):
            if rocks[i] != capacity[i]:
                j=capacity[i]-rocks[i]
                l.append(j)
        
        l.sort()

        m=len(l)
        for k in range(m):
            add = additionalRocks-l[k]
            if add<=0:
                break

        full= (k+1)+(n-m) #number of full bags
        return full


```


### errors
test case 1: failed <br>


## Attempt 03

realized that the error is because additionalRocks are not getting reduced, add should be additionalRocks<br>

```
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        
        l=[]
        n=len(capacity)

        for i in range(n):
            if rocks[i] != capacity[i]:
                j=capacity[i]-rocks[i]
                l.append(j)
        
        l.sort()

        m=len(l)
        for k in range(m):
            additionalRocks = additionalRocks-l[k]
            if additionalRocks<=0:
                break

        full= (k+1)+(n-m) #number of full bags
        return full


```

### errors
test case failed:<br>
failed to realize that just because the number of additionalRocks comes down to 0, implying that all additional rocks have been placed in bags. 
this, however, does not imply that each bag in which they were filled has full capacity.
this is valid for the last bag that the additional rocks are being put in since all previous(if any) bags' capacity was filled.<br>
<br>

## Attempt 04

this brought the realization that it would be easier to navigate through the code if I go by approach 1 instead of approach 2

# Solution

```
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        
        l=[]
        n=len(capacity)

        for i in range(n):
            if rocks[i] != capacity[i]:
                j=capacity[i]-rocks[i]
                l.append(j)
        
        m=len(l)
        l.sort()

        full1=n-m       #number of already full bags

        add=0
        for k in range(m):
            add=add+l[k]
            if add==additionalRocks:
                full2=k+1
                break
            elif add>additionalRocks:
                full2=k #(k-1)+1
                break
            else:
                full2=m

        full= full1 + full2 #number of full bags
        return full

        
```
here, runtime is high and it occupies a lot of memory. I believe there are better approaches to this question, I shall think about it an update.
