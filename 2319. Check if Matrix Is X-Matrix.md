# Solution 1
Reached on second Attempt
Starting fresh and from scratch with this question

## Conditions:
### A.
1. diagonal elements !=0
```
for i in range(len(grid)):
if grid[i][i]==0 or grid [i][n-i-1]==0:
    return False
```
2. non-diagonal elements ==0
To obtain non-diag elements, removal of diagonal elements from the grid must be done in the above loop itself
```
if all of remaining elements !=0
return False
```

If neither condition is false, it must return true
```
return True #at the end of the function after both loops
```
### B. pre-requisite understanding:

- when there are odd number of elements in the grid:
```grid[i][i]==grid[i][n-i-1]```
when removing grid elments, it will return error if so for removal of ```grid[i][n-i-1]``` after that of ```grid[i][i]``` since the latter has already been removed.

- ```[n-i-1]``` could have been ```[-i-1]``` simply
  but to check if overlapping occurs, ```[n-i-1]``` was used
  ```if i==n-i-1:``` overlapping occurs, otherwise not

- to check if all remaining elements, which are also the non-diagonal elements from the original grid, are zero, the following condition can be used:
```if grid[i].count(0)==len(grid[i])```
the above condition will be true if all elements of a row in grid are 0, which is required by condition 2

### Compiling A and B
```
class Solution:
    def checkXMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        n=len(grid)
        
        #condition for diagonal elements

        for i in range(n):
            a= grid[i][i]       #diag elements from l to r
            b= grid[i][n-i-1]   #diag elements from r to l
            if a==0 or b==0:
                return False
            grid[i].remove(a)   #removal of diag elements
            if i!=n-i-1:
                grid[i].remove(b)

        #non-diagonal elements= remaining elements
        for i in range(n):
            if grid[i].count(0)!=len(grid[i]):  #checking if all remaining elements in each row are zero
                return False
        
        return True     #if no condition is false, conditions satisfy
```

# Solution 2

```
class Solution:
    def checkXMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        n=len(grid)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i==j or i+j==n-1):
                    if grid[i][j]==0:
                        return False
                
                elif grid[i][j]!=0:
                    return False
        return True

```

# First Attempt

## Approach 01
```
class Solution:
    def checkXMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        n=len(grid)
        d=[]        #list of diagonal elements
        for i in range(n):
            d.append(grid[i][i])
            d.append(grid[i][n-i-1])

        if n%2!=0:
            d.append(grid[n//2][n//2])
        
        for i in d:
            if i==0:
                return False
        
        for j in range(n):
            for k in grid[j]:
                if k not in d and k!=0:
                    return False
    
        return True

```
Most of the test cases were passed but I can see a better way to approach this question so I'm abandoning this approach

## Approach 2
```
class Solution:
    def checkXMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        n=len(grid)

        for i in range(n):
            if grid[i][i]==0 or grid[i][n-i-1]==0:
                return False

        if n%2!=0:
            if grid[n//2][n//2]==0:
                return False

        for j in range(n):
            grid[j].pop(j)
            grid[j].pop(n-j-2)      #ideally should be n-j-1. but since j is removed in prev command, n-2-j
            for k in grid[j]:
                if k!=0:
                    return False
    
        return True
```
Error arises when grid[j][j] occurs on left to grid[j][n-i-1]

## Approach 3
```
class Solution:
    def checkXMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        n=len(grid)

        for i in range(n):
            if grid[i][i]==0 or grid[i][n-i-1]==0:
                return False

        if n%2!=0:
            if grid[n//2][n//2]==0:
                return False

        for j in range(n):
            for k in grid[j]:
                if index(k)==j or index(k)==(n-j-1):
                    continue
                else:
                    if k!=0:
                        return False
        return True
```
The error still arises.
