# Intuition
I wasn't sure of how to approach the question initially but if you put some more thought into the possible cases, two major cases come to light

### CASE 1: longest substring: 
            len(ss)=n/2
            s=ss*2
### CASE 2: shortest substring: 
        len(ss)=1
        s=ss*n

### Generalizing:
        s=ss*[len(s)/len(ss)]
    
        
***Hence, length of substrings must be factors of n*** as len(s)/len(ss) must be an integer


# Approach
Keeping the above deduction in mind, it would be ideal to know how many times a pattern must be repeated to form the original string, or what lengths of substrings are possible. 

For this, I've made a list of such possible substring lengths, called f, by appending the number of factors of len(s) smaller than its half(keeping extreme CASE 1 in mind)

Once f is ready, I have tested each possible substring of suitable length and multiplied it by len(s)/len(ss) to check if it coincides with the original string.



The code is as follows:


# Code
```
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:

        n=len(s)

        if 1>=n or n>10000:
            return False
        
        f=[] #list of possible factors or ss lengths
        for i in range(1, n//2 +1):
            if n%i==0:
                f.append(i)

        for i in f:
            ss=s[:i] #not s[:i+1] as i is length of ss
            if s==ss*(n//i): #modified n/i to n//i because float
                return True
            else:
                continue

        return False


        
```
