# Approach
We find the solution to the problem if we know two things, the highest frequency there and the count of numbers with the highest frequency. Multiplying these values gives us the required result.

To find these values, we can search for the highest frequency using the if statement nested in for loop that internally compares the maximum frequencies encountered, and stores the max at present using the variable `m`. 
Once the max frequency is established, all that is required is to keep a track of the numbers in nums with that max frequency with the variable `count`. This variable increments by 1 each time a numbe with the same max frequency in `nums` is encountered.

On the off-chance that there's a higher frequency, the value resets and so does the `count` to accomodate this newfound maximum frequency to reach the right answer.

To facilitate this methodology, it is necessary to not have a repeat of elements. To elaborate, once the frequency of a number has been considered, it shouldn't be considered again, otherwise the count increases by one for the same element. Hence, there is a need for analysis based on unique elements. This cannot be achieved by analyzing through nums, which may contain duplicates.
This is sought through using the propery of sets containing only unique elements. I have casted nums into a set, then casted the set into a list using `u=list(set(nums))` as sets are not iterable data structures. `u` is the list of unique elements of nums.

class Solution:
    def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        m=0
        count=0

        u=list(set(nums))

        for i in u: #needs unique elements for non-overlapping result
            if nums.count(i)>m:
                m=nums.count(i)
                count=1
            elif nums.count(i)==m:
                count+=1

        return m*count
```
