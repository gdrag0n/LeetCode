# Solution
```
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        #removing duplicates
        l=list(dict.fromkeys(list(s)))

        n= len(l)
        c=0
        for i in range(n):
            if s.count(l[i])==1:
                return s.index(l[i])
                break
            c=c+1
            
        #if there is no element with count=1
        if c==n:
            return -1
```


## Approach:
```
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        n=len(s)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                c=0
                while s[i]==s[j]:
                    c=c+1
                
                if c==n:
                #incomplete
```


Idek what i was doing here, but after doing 136 and 169, this question suddenly made a lot more sense to me.
