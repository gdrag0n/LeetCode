# Approach 1
```
class Solution:
    def shuffle(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:

        l1=nums[:n]
        l2=nums[n:2n]

        nums.clear()

        for i in range(n):
            nums.append(l1[i])
            nums.append(l2[i])

        return nums
```
2n was resulting in an error
Realized that 2n was a random variable here, so had to make a minor change which is truer to the meaning of 2n

class Solution:
    def shuffle(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:

        l1=nums[:n]
        l2=nums[n:2*n]

        nums.clear()

        for i in range(n):
            nums.append(l1[i])
            nums.append(l2[i])

        return nums
