# Approach
It's obvious that hashmap/dictionary will be used here. How?
Considering one string element is to be assigned to another, and dictionary allows us to make key:value pairs, it fits perfectly.

### conditions:
1. if length of both is not same, there cannot be an existing pattern, hence a condition for that must be included
2. bijective relationship must hold
3. individually unique key and values


### Step 1
words need to be considered separately, hence split() funtion

### Step 2
Start off by creating a pattern->s relationship
where keys are unique
as in, each element of s must be a value corresponding to alphabets from pattern as their key.

### Step 3
For a bijective relationship, it is mandatory to ensure that no two keys store the same corresponding value, hence all values are unique as well
Create a list of values present in dictionary and check their count

### Step 4
If all conditions are clear, return True

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:

        s=s.split()
        n=len(s)

        if n!=len(pattern):
            return False

        dic={}
        for i in range(n):
            if pattern[i] not in dic:
                dic[pattern[i]]=s[i]

            else:
                if dic[pattern[i]]!=s[i]:
                    return False

        l=list(dic.values())
        for i in l:
            if l.count(i)!=1:
                return False

        return True

```
