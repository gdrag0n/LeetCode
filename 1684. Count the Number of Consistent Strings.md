# Roundabout, simpler solution
to check the words that do not comply, and subtract that count from the total number of words
```
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:

        res=0
        for word in words:
            for i in word:
                if i not in allowed:
                    res=res+1
                    break
