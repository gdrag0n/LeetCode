# Intuition
obviously, gotta loop through the list and find number of words in each sentence. then the most natural thought process i'd been working on till now and i wouldve applied the same here would be to append the number of words in a list, while doing which i realized i might not need another list actually.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def mostWordsFound(self, sentences: List[str]) -> int:

        ans=0
        for i in sentences:
            c=len(i.split())    #returns number of words
            if c>ans:           #to avoid making a list
                ans=c

        return ans
```

# Approach
Upon further invesitgation, I saw scope to get rid of if else statement too.


# Code
```
class Solution:
    def mostWordsFound(self, sentences: List[str]) -> int:

        ans=0
        for i in sentences:
            c=len(i.split())    #returns number of words
            ans=max(ans,c)      #to avoid list and if-else

        return ans
