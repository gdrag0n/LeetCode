### concepts

l= _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
_ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ 
0 1 2 3   -4-3-2-1
n= len(l)= 8
i should go till (n/2)-1

l = _ _ _ _ _
_ _ | _ | _ _
0 1      -2-1
len(l)= 5
i should go till (n//2)-1

hence, condition for plaindrome: 
```
l[i]==l[-1-i]
where i goes till (n//2)-1

```
2.
### cases
x<=0 : return False
x> : loop


## Approach 01

- 	since x is an integer, we can cast it into a string since that'll allow us to naviate through its elements index-wise.
- 	I tend to prefer the for loop due to its easy implementation, but for loop did not sit well with this specific problem
	while i was writing the code and I decided for while loop instead.
- 

```
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
	
		y=str(x)			#casting
        n=len(y)

        i=0
        while y[i]==y[-1-i]:
            i=i+1
            if i>=(n//2):	#since i must go till n//2-1
                break		#will break out of the while loop altogether

        if i==(n//2):		#after full iteration from i=0 to the (n//2-1)th element, i+1 will return i's value to be n//2
            return True
        else:				#implies incomplete iteration, meaning either while loop condition returned false at some point
           return False
				
```

### errors
11505 / 11510 testcases passed

test case failed:
	x=0
	Expected: True
	Output: False
	
This made me realize that perhaps all numbers with n=1 will be considered as palindromes

# Solution
```

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:

        y=str(x)
        n=len(y)

        i=0
        while y[i]==y[-1-i]:
            i=i+1
            if i>=(n//2):
                break

        if i==(n//2):
            return True
        else:
           return False
