# Approach
From the given test case examples
Upon close observation we see that
1. nums should be sorted in ascending order
2. form pairs of every two elements starting from index 0
3. return sum of the first element in each pair, which is the same as sum of all even index elements
<br>

<strong>To summarize:</strong>
1. Sort Nums
2. Return sum of all even index integers


# Code
```
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        nums.sort()
        
        ans=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i%2==0:
                ans=ans+nums[i]

        return ans
```
