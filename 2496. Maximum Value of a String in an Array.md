# Solution
In a simple sense, uppercase and lowercase only exist for alphabets and not for numbers
Implying, uppercase of a number will be the same as its lowercase
This helps in creating a distinction between alphabets and integers

```
class Solution:
    def maximumValue(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:

        v=0
        for i in strs:
            if i.upper()==i.lower():
                a=int(i)
                if a>v:
                    v=a
            else:
                a=len(i)
                if a>v:
                    v=a
                
        return v
```
# Solution 2

```isdigit()``` is a function that performs the same role as ```i.upper()==i.lower()``` in the above solution and hence can be substituted with that.

# Solution 3
```
class Solution:
    def maximumValue(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        return max(int(s) if s.isdigit() else len(s) for s in strs)
        
```
