# Solution

```

class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        #m=len(nums1)
        #n=len(nums2)


        for i in range(m,m+n):
            nums1[i]=nums1[i]+nums2[i-m]

        nums1.sort()

```


## Approaches

the first approach tried, which did not work and i don't know why, was to slice nums1 upto m-1 index then add nums1 and nums2, i.e.
```
nums1=nums1[:m]
nums1=nums1+nums2
```

so i went for adding the n zeroes with n elements of nums2 itself, to have the desired list. then as mentioned, it was sorted to return the result.
